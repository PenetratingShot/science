      	<p class="q"><b>Q1: What are the natural resources that are used to make synthetic rubber?</b></p>
        <p class="a"><b>A1: There are only 4 natural products that naturally occur in the Earth's crust. These include crude oil, naphta (the dry distillation of coal, shale, etc), natural gas, water vapor (steam), and monomers such as butadiene, styrene, isoprene, and so on.</b></p>

      <div class="section">
        <p class="q"><b>Q2: What are the chemical processes used to make synthetic rubber?</b></p>
        <p class="a"><b>A2: First in the refinery they refine crude oil and then add naphta to it. Then they add the product of this to natural gas and then to a monomer molecule which allows it to be made into a polymer material. Then additive chemicals are put into the mix while steam thins out the rubber. The product of this is the synthetic rubber.</b></p>

      <div class="section">
        <p class="q"><b>Q3: What are the negative and positive impacts to society of making and using the synthetic product, compared to making and using a more natural product with a similar function?</b></p>
        <p class="a"><b>A3: There are quite a couple effects of using synthetic products. One positive effect is that we can make our materials to the strength and stamina that we need (custom specifications). Naturally occuring materials may not be able to live up to the standards that we expect. This as an example would be trying to make a hammer with gold, it just is not a justifiable practice. On the contrary, let's say that we wanted to make a hammer out of steel, this would be a justifiable practice because the steel has a much greater durability than the gold. One bad effect would be that the smog produced from the oil refineries could harm the environment.</b></p>
